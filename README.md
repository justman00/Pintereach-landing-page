# Pintereach-landing-page

In order to get started editing the less files, one must use <strong>less-watch-compiler</strong> , in order to be able to compile the changes into pure 
css code.

I have all of the images for each page stored in the <strong>img</strong> directories.

The designs were made by me and inspired from the world wide web.
