# Pintereach-landing-page

In order to get started editing the less files, one must use <strong>less-watch-compiler</strong> , in order to be able to compile the changes into pure 
css code.

I have all of the images for each page stored in the <strong>img</strong> directories.

The designs were made by me and inspired from the world wide web.

The site is deployed at <a href="https://peaceful-swanson-d610ff.netlify.com/">here</a>!

<h3>Any feedback is welcome and highly appreciated.</h3>
